Since the project runs on RMI. 
I. To run the application, the registry needs to be started first with a port number.
Syntax to start the registry:
1. On windows: start rmiregistry portnumber
2. Mac/Linux terminal: rmiregistry portnumber &

II. After starting the registry, the files need to be compiled and executed. 
Syntax:
Start the server:
javac *.java
java Server portnumber

Start the client with the same portnumber and IP address
III. Syntax:
java LoginPage IP Address portnumber

The login page here is the client. More than one client needs to login to check the system.
After login comes the create window, where the client should create a document with doc name and atleast one user. 

After adding the other user, the shared document will appear on the shared list of the client.
On opening the document one will get the same text written by the other client.
